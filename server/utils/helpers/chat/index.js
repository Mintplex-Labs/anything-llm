What is the message Array compressor?
TLDR: So anyway, i started blasting (your prompts & stuff)

messageArrayCompressor arose out of a need for users to be able to insert unlimited token prompts
and also maintain coherent history, system instructions and context, if applicable.

We took an opinionated approach that after much back-testing we have found retained a highly coherent answer
under most user conditions that a user would take while using this specific system. While other systems may
use a more advanced model for compressing message history or simplify text through a recursive approach - our is much more simple.

We "cannonball" the input.
Cannonball (verb): To ensure a prompt fits through a model window we blast a hole in the center of any inputs blocking our path to doing so.
This starts by dissecting the input as tokens and delete from the middle-out bi-directionally until the prompt window is satisfied.
You may think: "Doesn't this result in massive data loss?" - yes & no.
Under the use cases we expect the tool to be used, which is mostly chatting with documents, we are able to use this approach with minimal blowback
on the quality of responses.

We accomplish this by taking a rate-limit approach that is proportional to the model capacity. Since we support more than openAI models, this needs to
be generic and reliance on a "better summary" model just is not a luxury we can afford. The added latency overhead during prompting is also unacceptable.
In general:
  system: at best 15% of token capacity
  history: at best 15% of token capacity
  prompt: at best 70% of token capacity.

we handle overflows by taking an aggressive path for two main cases.

1. Very large user prompt
- Likely uninterested in context, history, or even system prompt. This is a "standalone" prompt that highjacks the whole thread.
- We run this prompt on its own since a prompt that is over 70% of context window certainly is standalone.

2. Context window is exceeded in regular use.
- We do not touch prompt since it is very likely to be <70% of window.
- We check system prompt is not outrageous - if it is we cannonball it and keep context if present.
- We check a sliding window of history, only allowing up to 15% of the history to pass through if it fits, with a
preference for recent history if we can cannonball to fit it, otherwise it is omitted.

We end up with a rather large prompt that fits through a given window with a lot of room for response in most use-cases.
We also take the approach that history is the least important and most flexible of the items in this array of responses.

There is a supplemental version of this function that also returns a formatted string for models like Claude-2

/**
 * Fill the sources window with the priority of
 * 1. Pinned documents (handled prior to function)
 * 2. VectorSearch results
 * 3. prevSources in chat history - starting from most recent.
 *
 * Ensuring the window always has the desired amount of sources so that followup questions
 * in any chat mode have relevant sources, but not infinite sources. This function is used during chatting
 * and allows follow-up questions within a query chat that otherwise would have zero sources and would fail.
 * The added benefit is that during regular RAG chat, we have better coherence of citations that otherwise would
 * also yield no results with no need for a ReRanker to run and take much longer to return a response.
 *
 * The side effect of this is follow-up unrelated questions now have citations that would look totally irrelevant, however
 * we would rather optimize on the correctness of a response vs showing extraneous sources during a response. Given search
 * results always take a priority a good unrelated question that produces RAG results will still function as desired and due to previous
 * history backfill sources "changing context" mid-chat is handled appropriately.
 * example:
 * ---previous implementation---
 * prompt 1: "What is raiqaAssistant?" -> possibly get 4 good sources
 * prompt 2: "Tell me some features" -> possible get 0 - 1 maybe relevant source + previous answer response -> bad response due to bad context mgmt
 * ---next implementation---
 * prompt 1: "What is raiqaAssistant?" -> possibly get 4 good sources
 * prompt 2: "Tell me some features" -> possible get 0 - 1 maybe relevant source + previous answer response -> backfill with 3 good sources from previous -> much better response
 *
