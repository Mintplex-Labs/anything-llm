CSS classes: * `ods-section`* - wrapper around the out-of-court dispute resolution section * `ods-description`* - intro text for the out-of-court dispute resolution. It may contain multiple segments and a link. * `ods-param`* - wrapper around the header-value pair for parameters that merchant may need to provide during the ODS process. * `ods-routing-id`* - ods param for the Routing ID. * `ods-reference-id`* - ods param for the Routing ID. * `ods-param-header`* - header for the ODS parameter * `ods-param-value`* - value of the ODS parameter. This value should be rendered in a way that it is easy for merchants to identify and copy. * `segment` - section of the text, `span` inside paragraph * `segment-attribute` - section of the text that represents a product attribute, for example 'image\_link' * `segment-literal` - section of the text that contains a special value, for example '0-1000 kg' * `segment-bold` - section of the text that should be rendered as bold * `segment-italic` - section of the text that should be rendered as italic * `tooltip` - used on paragraphs that should be rendered with a tooltip. A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example '?' or 'i'. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the '?' as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the 'i' as an icon.
