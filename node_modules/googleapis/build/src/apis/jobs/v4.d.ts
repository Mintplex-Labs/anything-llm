Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days.

Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time.
