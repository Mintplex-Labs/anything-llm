Example ranking expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 * dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. === CLEARBOX === If ranking_expression_backend is set to `CLEARBOX`, the following expression types (and combinations of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * double * signal * log(signal) * exp(signal) * rr(signal, double \> 0) -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a denominator constant. * is_nan(signal) -- returns 0 if signal is NaN, 1 otherwise. * fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double) -- if signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1.

Then the final order of the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how API orders "gender" and "rating" facets.
