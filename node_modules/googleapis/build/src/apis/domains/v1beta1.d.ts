     * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] \}, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", \} \} ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 \} ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar (Deprecated: For more information, see [Cloud Domains feature deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations)). First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) (Deprecated: For more information, see [Cloud Domains feature deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations)). First, call `RetrieveImportableDomains` to list domains to which the calling user has sufficient access. Then call `ImportDomain` on any domain names you want to use with Cloud Domains.

For domains already managed by [Google Domains](https://domains.google/), use `ImportDomain` instead. Before calling this method, go to the domain's current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `TRANSFER_PENDING`. It can take several days to complete the transfer process. The registrant can often speed up this process by approving the transfer through the current registrar, either by clicking a link in an email from the registrar or by visiting the registrar's website. A few minutes after transfer approval, the resource transitions to state `ACTIVE`, indicating that the transfer was successful. If the transfer is rejected or the request expires without being approved, the resource can end up in state `TRANSFER_FAILED`. If transfer fails, you can safely delete the resource and retry the transfer.
