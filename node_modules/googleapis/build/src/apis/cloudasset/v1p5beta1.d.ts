However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`\}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"\} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"\} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"\} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: "E3" value: "E4" inherit_from_parent: true\} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"\} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: "E1"\} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"\} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {\}\} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"\} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW\} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"\} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY\} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-\>{F1, F2\}; F1-\>{P1\}; F2-\>{P2, P3\}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "under:organizations/O1"\} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: "under:projects/P3"\} {denied_values: "under:folders/F2"\} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`.
