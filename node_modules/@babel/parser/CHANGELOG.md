Need to modify Babel for this AST node change, so moving to 7.0.

- Revert "Don't parse class properties without initializers when classProperties plugin is disabled, and Flow is enabled" ([#376](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/376))

[react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12542) broke with this so we reverted.

## 6.16.0 (2017-02-23)

### :rocket: New Feature

***ESTree*** compatibility as plugin ([#277](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/277)) (Daniel Tschinder)

We finally introduce a new compatibility layer for ESTree. To put babylon into ESTree-compatible mode the new plugin `estree` can be enabled. In this mode the parser will output an AST that is compliant to the specs of [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree/)

We highly recommend everyone who uses babylon outside of babel to use this plugin. This will make it much easier for users to switch between different ESTree-compatible parsers. We so far tested several projects with different parsers and exchanged their parser to babylon and in nearly all cases it worked out of the box. Some other estree-compatible parsers include `acorn`, `esprima`, `espree`, `flow-parser`, etc.

To enable `estree` mode simply add the plugin in the config:
```json
{
  "plugins": [ "estree" ]
}
```

If you want to migrate your project from non-ESTree mode to ESTree, have a look at our [Readme](https://github.com/babel/babylon/#output), where all deviations are mentioned.

Add a parseExpression public method ([#213](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/213)) (jeromew)

Babylon exports a new function to parse a single expression

```js
import { parseExpression } from 'babylon';

const ast = parseExpression('x || y && z', options);
```

The returned AST will only consist of the expression. The options are the same as for `parse()`

Add startLine option ([#346](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/346)) (Raphael Mu)

A new option was added to babylon allowing to change the initial linenumber for the first line which is usually `1`.
Changing this for example to `100` will make line `1` of the input source to be marked as line `100`, line `2` as `101`, line `3` as `102`, ...

Function predicate declaration ([#103](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/103)) (Panagiotis Vekris)

Added support for function predicates which flow introduced in version 0.33.0

```js
declare function is_number(x: mixed): boolean %checks(typeof x === "number");
```

Allow imports in declare module ([#315](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/315)) (Daniel Tschinder)

Added support for imports within module declarations which flow introduced in version 0.37.0

```js
declare module "C" {
  import type { DT } from "D";
  declare export type CT = { D: DT };
}
```

### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance

Forbid semicolons after decorators in classes ([#352](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/352)) (Kevin Gibbons)

This example now correctly throws an error when there is a semicolon after the decorator:

```js
class A {
@a;
foo(){}
}
```

Keywords are not allowed as local specifier ([#307](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/307)) (Daniel Tschinder)

Using keywords in imports is not allowed anymore:

```js
import { default } from "foo";
import { a as debugger } from "foo";
```

Do not allow overwritting of primitive types ([#314](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/314)) (Daniel Tschinder)

In flow it is now forbidden to overwrite the primitive types `"any"`, `"mixed"`, `"empty"`, `"bool"`, `"boolean"`, `"number"`, `"string"`, `"void"` and `"null"` with your own type declaration.

Disallow import type { type a } from â€¦ ([#305](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/305)) (Daniel Tschinder)

The following code now correctly throws an error

```js
import type { type a } from "foo";
```

Don't parse class properties without initializers when classProperties is disabled and Flow is enabled ([#300](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/300)) (Andrew Levine)

Ensure that you enable the `classProperties` plugin in order to enable correct parsing of class properties. Prior to this version it was possible to parse them by enabling the `flow` plugin but this was not intended the behaviour.

If you enable the flow plugin you can only define the type of the class properties, but not initialize them.

Fix export default async function to be FunctionDeclaration ([#324](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/324)) (Daniel Tschinder)

Parsing the following code now returns a `FunctionDeclaration` AST node instead of `FunctionExpression`.

```js
export default async function bar() {};
```

### :nail_care: Polish

Improve error message on attempt to destructure named import ([#288](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/288)) (Brian Ng)

Fail tests that have expected.json and throws-option ([#285](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/285)) (Daniel Tschinder)

### :memo: Documentation

Update contributing with more test info [skip ci] ([#355](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/355)) (Brian Ng)

Update API documentation ([#330](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/330)) (Timothy Gu)

AST spec: fix casing of `RegExpLiteral` ([#318](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/318)) (Mathias Bynens)

## 6.15.0 (2017-01-10)

### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance

Add support for Flow shorthand import type ([#267](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/267)) (Jeff Morrison)

This change implements flows new shorthand import syntax
and where previously you had to write this code:

```js
import {someValue} from "blah";
import type {someType} from "blah";
import typeof {someOtherValue} from "blah";
```

you can now write it like this:

```js
import {
  someValue,
  type someType,
  typeof someOtherValue,
} from "blah";
```

For more information look at [this](https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/2890) pull request.

flow: allow leading pipes in all positions ([#256](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/256)) (Vladimir Kurchatkin)

This change now allows a leading pipe everywhere types can be used:
```js
var f = (x): | 1 | 2 => 1;
```

Throw error when exporting non-declaration ([#241](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/241)) (Kai Cataldo)

Previously babylon parsed the following exports, although they are not valid:
```js
export typeof foo;
export new Foo();
export function() {};
export for (;;);
export while(foo);
```

### :bug: Bug Fix

Don't set inType flag when parsing property names ([#266](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/266)) (Vladimir Kurchatkin)

This fixes parsing of this case:

```js
const map = {
  [age <= 17] : 'Too young'
};
```

Fix source location for JSXEmptyExpression nodes (fixes #248) ([#249](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/249)) (James Long)

The following case produced an invalid AST
```js
<div>{/* foo */}</div>
```

Use fromCodePoint to convert high value unicode entities ([#243](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/243)) (Ryan Duffy)

When high value unicode entities (e.g. ðŸ’©) were used in the input source code they are now correctly encoded in the resulting AST.

Rename folder to avoid Windows-illegal characters ([#281](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/281)) (Ryan Plant)

Allow this.state.clone() when parsing decorators ([#262](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/262)) (Alex Rattray)

### :house: Internal

Update eslint-config-babel to the latest version ðŸš€ ([#273](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/273)) (greenkeeper[bot])

chore(package): update rollup to version 0.41.0 ([#272](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/272)) (greenkeeper[bot])

chore(package): update flow-bin to version 0.37.0 ([#255](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/255)) (greenkeeper[bot])

## 6.14.1 (2016-11-17)

### :bug: Bug Fix

Allow `"plugins": ["*"]` ([#229](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/229)) (Daniel Tschinder)

```js
{
  "plugins": ["*"]
}
```

Will include all parser plugins instead of specifying each one individually. Useful for tools like babel-eslint, jscodeshift, and ast-explorer.

## 6.14.0 (2016-11-16)

### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance

Throw error for reserved words `enum` and `await` ([#195](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/195)) (Kai Cataldo)

[11.6.2.2 Future Reserved Words](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-future-reserved-words)

Babylon will throw for more reserved words such as `enum` or `await` (in strict mode).

```
class enum {} // throws
class await {} // throws in strict mode (module)
```

Optional names for function types and object type indexers ([#197](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/197)) (Gabe Levi)

So where you used to have to write

```js
type A = (x: string, y: boolean) => number;
type B = (z: string) => number;
type C = { [key: string]: number };
```

you can now write (with flow 0.34.0)

```js
type A = (string, boolean) => number;
type B = string => number;
type C = { [string]: number };
```

Parse flow nested array type annotations like `number[][]` ([#219](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/219)) (Bernhard HÃ¤ussner)

Supports these form now of specifying array types:

```js
var a: number[][][][];
var b: string[][];
```

### :bug: Bug Fix

Correctly eat semicolon at the end of `DelcareModuleExports` ([#223](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/223))  (Daniel Tschinder)

```
declare module "foo" { declare module.exports: number }
declare module "foo" { declare module.exports: number; }  // also allowed now
```

### :house: Internal

 * Add node 7 (Daniel Tschinder)
 * chore(package): update flow-bin to version 0.34.0 ([#204](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/204)) (Greenkeeper)

## v6.13.1 (2016-10-26)

### :nail_care: Polish

- Use rollup for bundling to speed up startup time ([#190](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/190)) ([@drewml](https://github.com/DrewML))

```js
const babylon = require('babylon');
const ast = babylon.parse('var foo = "lol";');
```

With that test case, there was a ~95ms savings by removing the need for node to build/traverse the dependency graph.

**Without bundling**
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5233399/19420264/3133497e-93ad-11e6-9a6a-2da59c4f5c13.png)

**With bundling**

export const { foo: [ ,, qux7 ] } = bar;
```

## v6.11.5 (2016-10-12)

### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance

Fix: Check for duplicate named exports in exported destructuring assignments ([#144](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/144)) (Kai Cataldo)

```js
// `foo` has already been exported. Exported identifiers must be unique. (2:20)
export function foo() {};
export const { a: [{foo}] } = bar;
```

Fix: Check for duplicate named exports in exported rest elements/properties ([#164](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/164)) (Kai Cataldo)

```js
// `foo` has already been exported. Exported identifiers must be unique. (2:22)
export const foo = 1;
export const [bar, ...foo] = baz;
```

### :bug: Bug Fix

Fix: Allow identifier `async` for default param in arrow expression ([#165](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/165)) (Kai Cataldo)

```js
// this is ok now
const test = ({async = true}) => {};
```

### :nail_care: Polish

Babylon will now print out the token it's expecting if there's a `SyntaxError` ([#150](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/150)) (Daniel Tschinder)

```bash
# So in the case of a missing ending curly (`}`)
Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected } (30:0)
  28 |   }
  29 |
> 30 |
     | ^
```

## v6.11.4 (2016-10-03)

Temporary rollback for erroring on trailing comma with spread (#154) (Henry Zhu)

## v6.11.3 (2016-10-01)

### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance

Add static errors for object rest (#149) ([@danez](https://github.com/danez))

> https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread

Object rest copies the *rest* of properties from the right hand side `obj` starting from the left to right.

```js
let { x, y, ...z } =  { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 };
// x = 1
// y = 2
// z = { z: 3 }
```

#### New Syntax Errors:

**SyntaxError**: The rest element has to be the last element when destructuring (1:10)
```bash
> 1 | let { ...x, y, z } = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};
    |           ^
# Previous behavior:
# x = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }
# y = 2
# z = 3
```

Before, this was just a more verbose way of shallow copying `obj` since it doesn't actually do what you think.

**SyntaxError**: Cannot have multiple rest elements when destructuring (1:13)

```bash
> 1 | let { x, ...y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};
    |              ^
# Previous behavior:
# x = 1
# y = { y: 2, z: 3 }
# z = { y: 2, z: 3 }
```

Before y and z would just be the same value anyway so there is no reason to need to have both.

**SyntaxError**: A trailing comma is not permitted after the rest element (1:16)

```js
let { x, y, ...z, } = obj;
```

The rationale for this is that the use case for trailing comma is that you can add something at the end without affecting the line above. Since a RestProperty always has to be the last property it doesn't make sense.

get / set are valid property names in default assignment (#142) ([@jezell](https://github.com/jezell))

```js
// valid
function something({ set = null, get = null }) {}
```

## v6.11.2 (2016-09-23)

### Bug Fix

- [#139](https://github.com/babel/babylon/issues/139) Don't do the duplicate check if not an identifier (#140) @hzoo

```js
// regression with duplicate export check
SyntaxError: ./typography.js: `undefined` has already been exported. Exported identifiers must be unique. (22:13)
  20 |
  21 | export const { rhythm } = typography;
> 22 | export const { TypographyStyle } = typography
```

Bail out for now, and make a change to account for destructuring in the next release.

## 6.11.1 (2016-09-22)

### Bug Fix
- [#137](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/137) - Fix a regression with duplicate exports - it was erroring on all keys in `Object.prototype`. @danez

```javascript
export toString from './toString';
```

```bash
`toString` has already been exported. Exported identifiers must be unique. (1:7)
> 1 | export toString from './toString';
    |        ^
  2 |
```

## 6.11.0 (2016-09-22)

### Spec Compliance (will break CI)

- Disallow duplicate named exports ([#107](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/107)) @kaicataldo

```js
// Only one default export allowed per module. (2:9)
export default function() {};
export { foo as default };

// Only one default export allowed per module. (2:0)
export default {};
export default function() {};

// `Foo` has already been exported. Exported identifiers must be unique. (2:0)
export { Foo };
export class Foo {};
```

### New Feature (Syntax)

- Add support for computed class property names ([#121](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/121)) @motiz88

```js
// AST
interface ClassProperty <: Node {
  type: "ClassProperty";
  key: Identifier;
  value: Expression;
  computed: boolean; // added
}
```

```js
// with "plugins": ["classProperties"]
class Foo {
  [x]
  ['y']
}

class Bar {
  [p]
  [m] () {}
}
 ```

### Bug Fix

- Fix `static` property falling through in the declare class Flow AST ([#135](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/135)) @danharper

```js
declare class X {
    a: number;
    static b: number; // static
    c: number; // this was being marked as static in the AST as well
}
```

### Polish

- Rephrase "assigning/binding to rvalue" errors to include context ([#119](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/119)) @motiz88

```js
// Used to error with:
// SyntaxError: Assigning to rvalue (1:0)

// Now:
// Invalid left-hand side in assignment expression (1:0)
3 = 4

// Invalid left-hand side in for-in statement (1:5)
for (+i in {});
```

### Internal

- Fix call to `this.parseMaybeAssign` with correct arguments ([#133](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/133)) @danez
- Add semver note to changelog ([#131](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/131)) @hzoo

## 6.10.0 (2016-09-19)

> We plan to include some spec compliance bugs in patch versions. An example was the multiple default exports issue.

### Spec Compliance

* Implement ES2016 check for simple parameter list in strict mode ([#106](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/106)) (Timothy Gu)

> It is a Syntax Error if ContainsUseStrict of FunctionBody is true and IsSimpleParameterList of FormalParameters is false. https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/2016/#sec-function-definitions-static-semantics-early-errors

More Context: [tc39-notes](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2015-07/july-29.md#611-the-scope-of-use-strict-with-respect-to-destructuring-in-parameter-lists)

For example:

```js
// this errors because it uses destructuring and default parameters
// in a function with a "use strict" directive
function a([ option1, option2 ] = []) {
  "use strict";
}
 ```

The solution would be to use a top level "use strict" or to remove the destructuring or default parameters when using a function + "use strict" or to.

### New Feature

* Exact object type annotations for Flow plugin ([#104](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/104)) (Basil Hosmer)

Added to flow in https://github.com/facebook/flow/commit/c710c40aa2a115435098d6c0dfeaadb023cd39b8

Looks like:

```js
var a : {| x: number, y: string |} = { x: 0, y: 'foo' };
```

### Bug Fixes

* Include `typeParameter` location in `ArrowFunctionExpression` ([#126](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/126)) (Daniel Tschinder)
* Error on invalid flow type annotation with default assignment ([#122](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/122)) (Dan Harper)
* Fix Flow return types on arrow functions ([#124](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/124)) (Dan Harper)

### Misc

* Add tests for export extensions ([#127](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/127)) (Daniel Tschinder)
* Fix Contributing guidelines [skip ci] (Daniel Tschinder)

## 6.9.2 (2016-09-09)

The only change is to remove the `babel-runtime` dependency by compiling with Babel's ES2015 loose mode. So using babylon standalone should be smaller.

## 6.9.1 (2016-08-23)

This release contains mainly small bugfixes but also updates babylons default mode to es2017. The features for `exponentiationOperator`, `asyncFunctions` and `trailingFunctionCommas` which previously needed to be activated via plugin are now enabled by default and the plugins are now no-ops.

## 6.8.1 (2016-06-06)

### New Feature

- Parse type parameter declarations with defaults like `type Foo<T = string> = T`

### Bug Fixes
- Type parameter declarations need 1 or more type parameters.
- The existential type `*` is not a valid type parameter.
- The existential type `*` is a primary type

### Spec Compliance
- The param list for type parameter declarations now consists of `TypeParameter` nodes
- New `TypeParameter` AST Node (replaces using the `Identifier` node before)

```
interface TypeParameter <: Node {
  bound: TypeAnnotation;
  default: TypeAnnotation;
  name: string;
  variance: "plus" | "minus";
}
```

## 6.8.0 (2016-05-02)

#### New Feature

##### Parse Method Parameter Decorators ([#12](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/12))

> [Method Parameter Decorators](https://goo.gl/8MmCMG) is now a TC39 [stage 0 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/stage0.md).

Examples:

```js
class Foo {
  constructor(@foo() x, @bar({ a: 123 }) @baz() y) {}
}

export default function func(@foo() x, @bar({ a: 123 }) @baz() y) {}

var obj = {
  method(@foo() x, @bar({ a: 123 }) @baz() y) {}
};
```

##### Parse for-await statements (w/ `asyncGenerators` plugin) ([#17](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/17))

There is also a new node type, `ForAwaitStatement`.

> [Async generators and for-await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration) are now a [stage 2 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262#current-proposals).

Example:

```js
async function f() {
  for await (let x of y);
}
```
