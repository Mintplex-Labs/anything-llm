# Components Folder Instructions

This directory holds reusable React components for the OneNew frontend.

## Guidelines
- Write components as functional components using TypeScript (`.tsx`) where possible.
- Style components with Tailwind CSS utilities and the `onenew` theme tokens (e.g., `bg-bg-0`, `text-text-0`).
- When creating a new component folder, include a `README.md` or `AGENTS.md` describing the component's purpose and theming rules.
- Keep components focused; compose smaller pieces instead of monolithic files.
