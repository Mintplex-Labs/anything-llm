# Sidebar Component

The Sidebar renders navigation and workspace controls on the left side of the app.

## Guidelines
- Export the main Sidebar from `index.jsx`.
- Use `onenew` Tailwind tokens for colors, spacing, and borders; avoid hard-coded values.
- Subcomponents (`ActiveWorkspaces`, `SearchBox`, `SidebarToggle`) should remain presentational and stateless.
- Document props and behavior for any new Sidebar subcomponents in a `README.md` within their folder if added.
