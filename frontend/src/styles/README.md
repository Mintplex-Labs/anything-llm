# Styles

Global CSS assets for the React frontend. These files layer Tailwind's base with the custom `onenew` theme
and provide utilities, overrides, and component-level styles.

## Guidelines
- Prefer `.onenew-*` utilities and semantic CSS variables over raw colors.
- When adding new tokens or variants, document them in `STYLEGUIDE.md`.
- Co-locate new style sheets with related components when practical.
